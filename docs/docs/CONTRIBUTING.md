# Contributing
I've heard that you want to contribute to UOJ?

Great! Let's get started in svn://local\_uoj.ac/uoj and svn://local\_uoj.ac/judge_client (That is, If you didn't change the hostname of UOJ) These are two SVN repos. About the repos' permissions... You gotta do it manually...

This is how: you can add a line in /var/svn/uoj/conf/passwd
```
uoj = 666666
```
To add an administrator with a username of "<samp>uoj</samp>" and a password of "<samp>666666</samp>".

Then you can fiddley fiddley fiddle with the repo and blahblahblah...

After finishing changes locally, if you want to share the changes with othersï¼Œyou can put it in git (WHAT IN THE WORLD?) and then host it on github.

If your contributions are more than just the website's code, and you want to contribute to the database, filesystem etc, please make a folder in `app/upgrade`, e.g. `2333_create_table_qaq`. i.e. Start with a number, underscore, and write alphanumeric charaters. This name can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.

You can put some small scripts in this folder. When UOJ runs these scripts, it runs kinda like this:
```php
if (is_file("{$dir}/upgrade.php")) {
	$fun = include "{$dir}/upgrade.php";
	$fun("up");
}
if (is_file("{$dir}/up.sql")) {
	runSQL("{$dir}/up.sql");
}
if (is_file("{$dir}/upgrade.sh")) {
	runShell("/bin/bash {$dir}/upgrade.sh up");
}
```
You only need to run `php cli.php upgrade:up 2333_create_table_qaq` in `/var/www/uoj/app`. We call this process `up`.

You must write a script to revert this, we call this process `down`. After contributing, you need to make sure you can go back to the original system after `up`-ing and `down`-ing. Like `up`, you need to run `php cli.php upgrade:down 2333_create_table_qaq`. When UOJ runs these scripts, it runs kinda like this:
```php
if (is_file("{$dir}/upgrade.php")) {
	$fun = include "{$dir}/upgrade.php";
	$fun("down");
}
if (is_file("{$dir}/down.sql")) {
	runSQL("{$dir}/down.sql");
}
if (is_file("{$dir}/upgrade.sh")) {
	runShell("/bin/bash {$dir}/upgrade.sh down");
}
```

In the database, UOJ will log which upgrades it has done. When you run `php cli.php upgrade:latest`, UOJ will `up` all upgrades that aren't done in app/upgrade, in the order, increasive, of the number before the underscore in the directory name. So, after writing those small upgrades, you can share with others!

WHAT? YOU NEED ME TO DO ABOUT ARCHITECTURE?
